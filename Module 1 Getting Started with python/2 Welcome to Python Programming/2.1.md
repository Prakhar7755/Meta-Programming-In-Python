Python supports various data types that allow you to store and manipulate different kinds of information. Let's explore some of the essential data types along with code examples:

1. **Numeric Data Types**:

   - **Integer (`int`)**: Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero). For example:

     ```python
     num1 = 5
     print(num1, 'is of type', type(num1))  # Output: 5 is of type <class 'int'>
     ```

   - **Floating-Point (`float`)**: Represents decimal numbers. It's accurate up to 15 decimal places. For example:

     ```python
     num2 = 2.0
     print(num2, 'is of type', type(num2))  # Output: 2.0 is of type <class 'float'>
     ```

   - **Complex (`complex`)**: Represents complex numbers (with a real and imaginary part). For example:
     ```python
     num3 = 1 + 2j
     print(num3, 'is of type', type(num3))  # Output: (1+2j) is of type <class 'complex'>
     ```

2. **String (`str`)**:

   - Represents a sequence of characters. For example:
     ```python
     name = "John"
     print("Hello, " + name)  # Output: Hello, John
     ```

3. **List (`list`)**:

   - An ordered collection of items (similar or different types) enclosed within square brackets `[]`. For example:
     ```python
     languages = ["Swift", "Java", "Python"]
     print(languages[0])  # Output: Swift
     print(languages[2])  # Output: Python
     ```

4. **Tuple (`tuple`)**:

   - Similar to a list but immutable (cannot be modified after creation). Enclosed within parentheses `()`. For example:
     ```python
     product = ('Xbox', 499.99)
     ```

5. **Boolean (`bool`)**:

   - Represents either `True` or `False`. Useful for conditions and logical operations.

6. **Set (`set`) and Frozenset (`frozenset`)**:

   - Sets hold a collection of unique items, while frozensets are immutable sets.

7. **Dictionary (`dict`)**:
   - Holds data in key-value pairs. For example:
     ```python
     student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}
     print(student["name"])  # Output: Alice
     ```

Remember that Python treats everything as an object, and data types are actually classes. Variables are instances (objects) of these classes. Feel free to explore more about these data types and their properties in your Python programs! üêçüî¢üìö
