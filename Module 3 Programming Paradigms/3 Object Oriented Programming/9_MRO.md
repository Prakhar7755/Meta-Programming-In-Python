Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which classes are searched for a particular method or attribute. Understanding MRO is essential in Python's multiple inheritance system, where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. MRO ensures that the methods and attributes are searched in a predictable and consistent order.

Let's start with an example:

```python
class A:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from A")

class B(A):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from B")

class C(A):
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.greet()
```

In this example, class `D` inherits from both class `B` and class `C`, which in turn inherit from class `A`. When we call `d.greet()`, which `greet` method will be executed?

Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO. It combines the MROs of all parent classes in a specific order. In this case, the MRO of `D` is calculated as `[D, B, C, A, object]`, meaning Python will first look for the method in `D`, then in `B`, then in `C`, then in `A`, and finally in `object`.

To see the calculated MRO, you can use the `.mro()` method:

```python
print(D.mro())
```

Output:

```
[<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>]
```

Now, let's discuss the use of `help()`:

```python
help(D)
```

This will print out documentation about the class `D`, including its methods, attributes, and the Method Resolution Order. It's a handy way to understand the structure of a class and its inheritance hierarchy.

Understanding MRO is crucial for avoiding ambiguity and unexpected behavior in complex class hierarchies, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance. It ensures that method and attribute resolution follow a consistent and predictable order.
