In Java, the counterparts of the Python data types are as follows:

1. Numeric Types:
   - int: Represents integer values, similar to Python's `int`.
   - double: Represents floating-point numbers, similar to Python's `float`.
   - float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers, similar to Python's `float`.
   - long: Represents long integer values, similar to Python's `int` but with a larger range.
   - byte: Represents a signed 8-bit integer.

2. Text Type:
   - String: Represents strings of characters, similar to Python's `str`.

3. Sequence Types:
   - Array: Represents fixed-size ordered collections of elements. Unlike Python lists, arrays in Java have a fixed length and can only contain elements of the same type.
   - ArrayList: Represents a variable-size ordered collection of elements, similar to Python's `list`. It can dynamically grow or shrink as needed.

4. Mapping Type:
   - HashMap: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, similar to Python's `dict`. It provides fast lookup and insertion times.

5. Set Types:
   - HashSet: Represents an unordered collection of unique elements, similar to Python's `set`. It does not allow duplicate values.
   - TreeSet: Represents a sorted set of unique elements.

6. Boolean Type:
   - boolean: Represents a boolean value, similar to Python's `bool`. It can have the values `true` or `false`.

7. Null Type:
   - null: Represents the absence of a value, similar to Python's `None`.

Java is a statically typed language, which means you need to explicitly declare the type of variables before using them. Additionally, Java is an object-oriented language, so you can define your own classes and create custom data types using objects.
