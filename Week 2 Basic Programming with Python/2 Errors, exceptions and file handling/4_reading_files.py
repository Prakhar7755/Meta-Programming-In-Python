""" You want to read the entire contents of a file. What two methods can you use to do this?

read()

Thatâ€™s right. The Read method returns the entire contents of the file as a string that will contain all the characters.

readlines()

That's right. The Readlines method reads the entire contents of the file and then returns it in an ordered list. This is useful because it allows you to iterate over the list or pick out specific lines based on a condition.
